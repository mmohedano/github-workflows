This repository explains two essential git commands that we are going to use in our w

### Git checkout

In Git terms, a "checkout" is the act of switching between different versions of a target entity. The git checkout command operates upon three distinct entities: **files, commits, and branches**. In addition to the definition of "checkout" the phrase "checking out" is commonly used to imply the act of executing the git checkout command. 

Checking out branches is similar to checking out old commits and files in that the working directory is updated to match the selected branch/revision; however, new changes are saved in the project history—that is, it’s not a read-only operation.

### Git diff

Show changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, changes between the index and a tree, changes between two trees, changes resulting from a merge, changes between two blob objects, or changes between two files on disk. [More info](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff)
